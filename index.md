## About me

I am a Research Associate at Imperial College London in the Department of Chemical Engineering. I am primarily interested in the modelling of future of energy systems.

I have an MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and PhD in Computer Science from University College London and Newcastle University respectively.

### Research

I am interested in the use of computer software and simulations to model complex systems. By modelling these systems, one is able to better understand and optimise them without making the mistakes in the real world. 

Much of my own work has involved the modelling of electricity markets, both over the short and long-term using agent-based models and optimisation [1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3396851.3397682), [2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3396851.3402369).
